# Wizardrium

> Welcome, Traveler. My name is Artem Trubin and as for now, I am a student that makes his first steps into Frontend Web Development. I am willing to store expand any knowledge that I get during learning and most importantly, share it. This storage of interesting and usefull stuff that I come across on this journey is created to help both me and those, who stumble upon it. As for me - it helps with my English skill and allows me to remember more things, as I rewrite and review stuff that was noted down earlier by making these articles. As for you - I try to save only the most important information. By no means __Wizardrium__ should be used as a guide, more like a reference, a collection of useful notes. Any suggestions for improvement are greatly appreciated.

Hi! And welcome. This repository is a home to __Wizardrium__, a compilation of notes and useful information gathered by me during my learning. It is about programming in general (though, right now it's mostly about front-end web development). Enjoy!

To start, head to the main [table of contents](contents.md).
