# Web development

> Welcome, Traveler. When we can't understand something it looks like _magic_ to us. When we can finally research something that looked like magic in the past, it becomes _science_. When we can master it, it becomes _art_. For me, __Web Development__ is a combination of all of those. The vast, ever-expanding world of html/css/js is something yet to be learned by anyone who desires to step in this sphere. And  people who build unbelievable, beautiful, convenient and swift as the wind user interfaces and applications are true wizards for me. So I present you this book of knowledge, since knowledge is power.
